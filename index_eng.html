            <p class="intro__text">According to VTSIOM surveys, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere, but only 36% plan to spend a vacation in their native country. Like, what didn't we see here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole universe with the gentle sea of the South,
                dense forests of the Sayan mountains and the harsh ice of the Putorana plateau. And you can see all these beauties without millions on your account, a foreign passport and many hours of flights. For example, Vera Bashmakova-a brave young
                mother who took three children in her arms, sat them in her Lada and drove 20 thousand kilometers across her native country. We have selected and described some interesting places worthy of your vacation.</p>

                    <p class="place__paragraph">Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia. First of all, because of the mountains: if you go along the ridge, you will see slopes dotted with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes. And if you open the car Windows, you can
                        get acquainted with the invisible miracle of these places-the mountain air.</p>
                    <p class="place__paragraph">The climate in Altai is moderate, so it is best to go here in the summer. This way you will see all the variety of local flora and fauna. Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges, and ROE deer graze on the plains.
                        And the famous manuls are also inhabitants of the Altai territory.</p>

                    <p class="place__paragraph">Of course, this is all true. But the lake ideal for competitions skijoring. This is a sport where a skier ties himself to a motorcycle, and the tandem tries to develop as much speed as possible on the ice. In March 2019, the Baikal
                        mile festival set a world record of 197.011 km/h.</p>

                        of impassable swamps. Some pines are more than half a Millennium old. Touch a living being who saw the sun before Ivan the terrible saw it. You can't find a trail for a hundred kilometers in a virgin forest. And on rare paths,
                        trees a few meters from the ground are marked with bear claws. So that everyone knows who is the boss.</p>
